      From a young age I was always interested in robotics and computers. My
      first exposure to this came with tv and movies, movies like robots and
      cloudy with a chance of meatballs instilled the desire for technical
      skills at a young age.
      <br /><br />
      In elementary school I joined an after school robotics program, learning
      to build simple circuits with breadboards, switches, resistors and various
      other components, eventually leading into arduinos and coding small robots
      in C#. In middle school, I spent less time working with things of this
      nature, but in my first two years of high school I completed my high
      schools digital design and computer coding courses. These included
      building websites with the absolute basic html and css, as well as
      programming games in javascript. The skills I learned in these classes
      carried over very well to college. After high school I did not have a
      specific goal in mind, so I decided to try community college, taking the
      100 level computer science courses. It was through my community college
      experiences that I rediscovered my love for technical work, as well as my
      love for mathematics. I completed my Associate of Science through PCC in
      2024, and began at Portland State University. Here I dove deeper into the
      subject of computer science, working towards a Bachelor of Science in
      Computer Science.

        Yeah. We not that fancy. This is just a school project. If this were a
        real website with more of a purpose this is where we would put an option
        to report bugs and whatnot but not this one.
