This website is the final project for Caterina Pauns Fall 2025 intro to web development course.

This website uses HTML CSS and Javascript.

The website has 5 pages, a home page, an about me page, a resume page, a page describing some previous projects, and a contact me page.

Home page:
The home page is pretty simple. Just says the website.

About me:
This is a short story about my personal experience.

Resume:
a basic resume using html elements and css selectors to get the right sizes and fonts

Projects:
a page with all of the previous projects Ive worked on, and links to the github repos. As well as a hangman game I made in JS. It is functional if you want to play it. These are individually wrapped in divs in a flexbox.

Contact page:
This is a page where you can put in a sender email, and a message and submit it to be sent to me. (It just prints it in console log.)

Check out the report an issue button as well, the image that comes up is anchored with a link as well. Also the menu shrinks using media queries, the projects page is just a little broken in phone mode, flexbox and media queries interact interestingly
